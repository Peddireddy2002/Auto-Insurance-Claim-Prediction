## 🆘 **Having Issues?**

### **Common Problems:**

**"Python not found"**
```bash
# Install Python 3.9+ from python.org
# Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
```

**"Permission denied"**
```bash
# Mac/Linux: Run with bash
bash INSTALL.sh

# Windows: Run as Administrator
```

**"Tesseract not found"**
```bash
# This is optional - demo still works!
# For full OCR: Install from tesseract GitHub releases
```

### **Get Help:**
1. Check error messages carefully
2. Read `STUDENT_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
3. Try the simple demo first: `python demo_script.py`
4. Ask your instructor or classmates
